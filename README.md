# TicTacVoice
Because you aren't using your toe #uottaHack2k18

### Summary
We take one of the most classic game ever, Tic-Tac-Toe, and make it accessible so that anyone could play it. The idea was to use Voice Recognition APIs to get the input from the user on where to put their peace, and Text-to-speech to convey the current board state and instructions to the user. 

This app was created for uOttaHack 2018 and won a categorical prize.
